Tool for the verification of the reliability of the H/V curve
and the clarity of the H/V peak according to the SESAME criteria.
<http://sesame.geopsy.org/Papers/HV_User_Guidelines.pdf>
This tool automatically reads the parameters needed for the verification 
from the output files of the H/V toolbox (.hv and .log) of the GEOPSY
software <http://www.geopsy.org/>.
This version allows to verify H/V curves calculated with fixed or
variable windows length.

INSTRUCTIONS
1) Open the H/V-TEST.m file in your MATLAB environment.
2) Change the .hv and .log filenames at the corresponding rows (instead of the default TEST files). For instructions on how to produce the .hv and .log files, please 
   refer to the GEOPSY manual.
3) Execute the code.
4) The results will be displayed in the Command Window
